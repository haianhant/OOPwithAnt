1.3 Compare Swing and AWT elements
1. Top-Level Containers
*AWT:
Frame: The primary top-level container for AWT applications.
Dialog: Used to create dialog windows (both modal and non-modal).
Applet: Used for creating applets to run in a web browser.

*Swing:
JFrame: The primary top-level container for Swing applications. It is a subclass of java.awt.Frame but provides more features.
JDialog: Used to create dialog windows in Swing. It extends java.awt.Dialog.
JApplet: Used for creating applets in Swing. It extends java.applet.Applet.
JWindow: A Swing container that extends java.awt.Window and provides additional features.

2. Component Class Names
AWT vs. Swing Components:

AWT Class Name	Corresponding Swing Class Name
Button	         	JButton
Label	         	JLabel
TextField	 	JTextField
TextArea	 	JTextArea
Checkbox	 	JCheckBox
Choice	         	JComboBox
List	         	JList
Canvas	         	JPanel
Scrollbar	 	JScrollBar
ScrollPane	 	JScrollPane
Panel	         	JPanel
Menu	         	JMenu
MenuBar	         	JMenuBar
MenuItem	 	JMenuItem
CheckboxMenuItem	JCheckBoxMenuItem
PopupMenu	 	JPopupMenu

3. Event Handling
*AWT Event Handling:
AWT uses the Delegation Event Model introduced in JDK 1.1.
Event listeners in AWT are part of the java.awt.event package.
AWT components generate events that are handled by event listeners. For instance, an ActionEvent from a Button is handled by an ActionListener.

*Swing Event Handling:
Swing also uses the Delegation Event Model.
Swing extends the AWT event handling mechanism. Event listeners are part of the javax.swing.event package as well as the java.awt.event package.
Swing provides more sophisticated event handling capabilities. For example, JButton uses an ActionListener just like Button, but Swing adds more listener types such as ChangeListener for JSlider and JSpinner.

3.1.4
To improve the code so that it correctly checks if a Media item implements the Playable interface and creates a "Play" button accordingly, we can make use of the instanceof operator. This operator checks if an object is an instance of a specific class or interface.
